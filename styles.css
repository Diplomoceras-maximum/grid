/*

    === What is grid? ===

    1. Grid is often used for easier placement of items in a two-dimensional layout (rows and columns)
    2. Grid is much better at matching items evenly in size
    3. Grid can be paired with flexbox, flexboxs can be placed inside grids and the opposite is also true
    4. The difference with flexbox is that instead of wrapping elements onto a new row, grid works in rows and columns and they can be added and removed when needed
